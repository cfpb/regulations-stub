For example, for the loan terms table required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(b), the settlement agent would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is provided in accordance with \u00a7 1026.19(f), the creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor.

Recording fees are not charges for third-party services because recording fees are paid to the applicable government entity where the documents related to the mortgage transaction are recorded, and thus, the condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(B) that the charge for third-party service not be paid to an affiliate of the creditor is inapplicable for recording fees. The condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(C), that the creditor permits the consumer to shop for the third-party service, is similarly inapplicable. Therefore, estimates of recording fees need only satisfy the condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A) to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii).",

For example, \u201cmonthly interest accrual amortization\u201d treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.",

Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount that is disclosed in the alternative \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.38(e) is shown to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate\u2019s \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.37(h), which is shown to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a \u201cFinal\u201d amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding \u201cEstimate\u201d amount shown to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii), and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under \u00a7 1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(i) is $12,500, and the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in \u201cTotal Closing Costs,\u201d no statement of such increase is given under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(iii) so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.",

There are two elements to satisfying \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). First, a nonprofit entity must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities. For each associated nonprofit entity, the small servicer determination is made separately, without consideration of the number of loans serviced by another associated nonprofit entity. Second, a nonprofit entity must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is the creditor. To be the creditor, the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A nonprofit entity is not a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is not the creditor (that is, for which the servicer or an associated nonprofit entity was not the originator). The first of the following two examples demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it meets both requirements for determining a nonprofit entity's status as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). The second example demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would not qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it does not meet both requirements under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C).",

The disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(5) apply only to a mortgage loan that is a closed-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by a dwelling or real property and that is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33. In an open-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires covered person to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (4), but not the partial payment policy disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(5). If, however, the dwelling in the open-end consumer credit credit transaction is not the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling (e.g., it is used solely for vacation purposes), none of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d) is required because the transaction is not a mortgage loan for purposes of \u00a7 1026.39. See \u00a7 1026.39(a)(2). In contrast, a closed-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by the consumer\u2019s dwelling that is not the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling is considered a mortgage loan for purposes of \u00a7 1026.39. Assuming that the transaction is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide the disclosures under \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (5). But if the transaction is a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide only the disclosures under \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (4).",

For the first five years of the loan term, the scheduled payments cover only interest and the loan has an introductory interest rate that is fixed at 4.00 percent. After five years, the payments include principal and the interest rate adjusts every three years based on the value of the Monthly Treasury Average index plus a margin of 4.00 percent.

For example, assume that at consummation the consumer must pay four itemized charges that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the actual amounts paid by the consumer for the four itemized charges subject to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) exceeded their respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) by $30, $25, $25, and $10, then there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations prescribed by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If, further, the amounts paid by the consumer for services that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) totaled $1,190, but the respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) totaled only $1,000, then there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations prescribed by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii). The creditor does not violate \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the creditor refunds the excess to the consumer no later than 60 days after consummation. The creditor does not violate \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor delivers or places in the mail corrected disclosures reflecting the $180 refund of the excess amount collected no later than 60 days after consummation.

For example, if the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment 37(b)(4)\u20132.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4).",

Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when the period during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on the consumer, to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) and (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an aggregated amount and time period for the information required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, both disclosures are made under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) as one aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the prepayment penalty, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7).

Upon arrival at the subject property, the appraiser discovers that the property is actually a single-family dwelling located on a farm. A different schedule of appraisal fees applies to residences located on farms. A changed circumstance has occurred (i.e., information provided by the consumer is found to be inaccurate after the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided), which caused an increase in the cost of the appraisal. Therefore, if the creditor issues revised disclosures with the corrected appraisal fee, the actual appraisal fee of $400 paid at the real estate closing by the consumer will be compared to the revised appraisal fee of $400 to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the creditor failed to provide revised disclosures, then the actual appraisal fee of $400 must be compared to the originally disclosed estimated appraisal fee of $200.",

For example, assume a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts every month for the first 12 months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment and the periodic payment that would apply after each payment adjustment during the first 12 months and would also disclose, as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the periodic principal and interest payment or range of payments that would apply after the payment becomes fixed. Assume instead a loan with a 30- year term with a payment that adjusts upward at three months and at six months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first year of the loan. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the oneyear anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the first year of the loan. Assume that the same loan has a payment that, instead of becoming fixed after the adjustment at six months, adjusts once more at 18 months and becomes fixed thereafter. The creditor would disclose the same single range of payments for year one. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), the creditor also discloses the principal and interest payment that would apply on the oneyear anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment (as required by \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D)) and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at 18 months as a single range of payments in year two. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the two-year anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the second year of the loan.",

If the creditor has obtained any appraisals or valuations of the property for the application at the time the disclosure is issued to the consumer, the value determined by the appraisal or valuation to be used during underwriting for the application is disclosed as the estimated property value. If the creditor has obtained multiple appraisals or valuations and has not yet determined which one will be used during underwriting, it may disclose the value from any appraisal or valuation it reasonably believes it may use in underwriting the transaction. In a transaction that involves a seller, if the sale price is not yet known, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.37(a)(7) if it discloses the estimated value of the property that it used as the basis for the disclosures in the Loan Estimate.",

The provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) apply prior to a consumer's receipt of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and therefore, restrict activity that may occur prior to receipt of an application by a creditor or mortgage broker under \u00a7 1026.19(e). These provisions include \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer's application. Accordingly, the provisions under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. In addition, the amendments to \u00a7 1026.28 and the commentary to \u00a7 1026.29 govern the preemption of State laws and thus, the amendments to those provisions and associated commentary made by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date.

The following example illustrates the meaning of 60 days past due for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3):",

For example, for an adjustable rate transaction that has a discounted interest rate during an initial five-year period, the creditor makes the calculation using a composite rate based on the rate in effect during the initial five-year period and, thereafter, the fully-indexed rate, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

The consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part instead of Regulation M. Under \u00a7 1026.38(t)(1)(ii), creditors may not include any additional information in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.38.

A creditor is not required to collect the consumer\u2019s name, monthly income, social security number to obtain a credit report, the property address, an estimate of the value of the property, or the mortgage loan amount sought. However, for purposes of determining whether an estimate is provided in good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor is presumed to have collected these six pieces of information.

For example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may also be an unexpected event specific to the consumer or the transaction. For example, if the creditor provided an estimate of title insurance on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the title insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the creditor relied on the consumer\u2019s income when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the consumer represented to the creditor that the consumer had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the consumer\u2019s annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a mortgage loan. One applicant\u2019s income was $30,000, while the other applicant\u2019s income was $50,000. If the creditor relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.",

See section \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and associated commentary for guidance regarding when the negative amortization period ends for purposes of \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2). For example, if the maximum principal balance for the last payment in the negative amortization period is achieved at an interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation before the negative amortization period ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in effect at the end of the negative amortization period was such interest rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the negative amortization period, the general rule under \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A) regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature is determined pursuant to the general rule under \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A).",

If during the 30-day period following consummation, an event in connection with the settlement of the transaction occurs that causes such disclosures to become inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller from that amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent shall deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures not later than 30 days after receiving information sufficient to establish that such event has occurred. Section 1026.19(f)(4)(i) requires disclosure of the items that relate to the seller\u2019s transaction. Thus, the settlement agent need only redisclose if an item related to the seller\u2019s transaction becomes inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller. For example, assume a transaction where the seller pays the transfer tax, the consummation occurs on Monday, and the security instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. If the settlement agent receives information on Tuesday sufficient to establish that transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent complies with \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(ii) by revising the disclosures accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail not later than 30 days after Tuesday. See comment 19(e)(4)(i)\u20131 for guidance on when sufficient information has been received to establish an event has occurred. See also comment 19(f)(2)(iii)\u20131.iii for another example in which corrected disclosures must be provided to the seller.",

A creditor may find that, even though it developed an averagecost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), over time it has collected more from consumers than it has paid to settlement service providers. For example, assume a creditor defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through April 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $115. The creditor then decreases the average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the creditor has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to settlement service providers for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $115 per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $125. Based on the average cost to the creditor from the May to August period, the average charge to the consumer for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the creditor spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the creditor remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from consumers does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding settlement services over time. The creditor may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the creditor may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected consumers. Or the creditor may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a creditor is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a creditor defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the creditor uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the creditor recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the creditor complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), even if the creditor actually collected more from consumers than was paid to providers over time.",

A creditor may delay the period by a reasonable amount of time if such delay is needed to perform the necessary analysis and update the affected systems, provided that each subsequent period is scheduled accordingly. For example, a creditor may define a fourmonth period from January 1 to April 30 and begin using the average charge from that period on May 15, provided the average charge is used until September 15, at which time the average charge for the period from May 1 to August 31 becomes effective.",

            "text":"If the loan has an adjustable rate under which the regular periodic payments may increase after consummation, but the amounts of such payment increases (if any) are unknown at the time of consummation, then the regular periodic payments are based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rates, the application of any interest rate adjustment caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For analogous guidance, see comments 17(c)(1)\u20138 and \u201310. Similarly, if a loan has an adjustable interest rate which does not adjust the regular periodic payment but would, if the rate increased, increase only the final payment, the amount of the final payment for purposes of the balloon payment determination is based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rate caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For example, assume that, under a 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, (1) the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully-indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fullyindexed rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (i.e., based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments, even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through five.",

Non-specific lender credits are generalized payments from the creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1). Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a creditor to the consumer to pay for a specific fee. Nonspecific lender credits and specific lender credits are negative charges to the consumer. The actual total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the creditor that is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) and disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e) is an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the consumer, the creditor has not complied with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), and is therefore, an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the creditor increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because, although the credit increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the consumer did not. However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50, then the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) have been violated because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount of the lender credit decreased. See also \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) and comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)\u20131 for a discussion of lender credits in the context of interest rate dependent charges.",

Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount that is disclosed in the \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.38(i) is shown rounded to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate\u2019s \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.37(h), which is shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a \u201cFinal\u201d amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding.

For example, if the \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(i) is $12,500, and the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in \u201cTotal Closing Costs,\u201d no statement of such increase is given under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(iii) so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.",

For example, assume that, prior to providing the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor believed that the consumer was eligible for a loan program that did not require an appraisal. The creditor then provides the estimated disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), which do not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered that the consumer was delinquent on mortgage loan payments in the past, making the consumer ineligible for the loan program originally identified on the estimated disclosures, but the consumer remains eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure.

For example, if the creditor requires homeowner\u2019s insurance but fails to include a homeowner\u2019s insurance premium on the estimates provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor\u2019s failure to disclose does not comply with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).

If, however, the creditor estimates consistent with the best information reasonably available that the loan will close on the 30th of the month and bases the estimate of prepaid interest accordingly, but the loan actually closed on the 1st of the next month instead, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).",

Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) also provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures, it must comply with all relevant requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e). This means that \u201cmortgage broker\u201d should be read in the place of \u201ccreditor\u201d for all provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e), except to the extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage brokers under \u00a7 1026.19(f). To illustrate, comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 states that creditors comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are reflected in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). \u201cMortgage broker\u201d could not be read in place of \u201ccreditor\u201d in comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 because mortgage brokers are not responsible for the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). In addition, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the creditor must ensure that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers comply with all requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e), and that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers that do comply with all such requirements satisfy the creditor\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 1026.19(e). The term \u201cmortgage broker,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii), has the same meaning as in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(2). See also comment 36(a)\u20132. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(B) provides that if a mortgage broker provides any disclosure required under \u00a7 1026.19(e), the mortgage broker must also comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.25(c). For example, if a mortgage broker provides the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), it must maintain records for three years, in compliance with \u00a7 1026.25(c)(1)(i).",
