The time period for which the compensation is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which compensation is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the compensation subject to the 10-percent limit and the total compensation are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a creditor pays an individual loan originator compensation in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the individual loan originator's performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the individual loan originator. The employer desires to pay the individual loan originator a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total compensation limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the compensation subject to the 10-percent limit and the total compensation for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the individual loan originator's compensation that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total compensation would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) because it does not exceed 10 percent of total compensation.

A company, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable, may pay compensation subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period.

A non-deferred profits-based compensation plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred compensation that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or other form of deferred compensation are determined based upon the mortgage-related profits of the person making the contribution, the contribution or benefits are not permitted by \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contribution to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by \u00a7 1026.36(d)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the individual loan originator may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred compensation, and the amount to be paid out from the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan and the distributions to the individual loan originators may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the person (e.g., the person may elect not to pay compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan in a given year), provided the distributions are not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions.

At the end of the year, the loan originator organization wishes to pay the individual loan originator a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations. Assume that the loan originator organization derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by \u00a7 1026.36(d). In this example, the performance bonus would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple individual loan originators' transactions as described in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(i), because it is being funded out of a profit pool derived in part from mortgage originations. Thus, the bonus is permissible under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if it does not exceed 10 percent of the loan originator's total compensation, which in this example consists of the individual loan originator's salary, commissions, contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the loan originator organization elects to include the contribution in calculating total compensation), and the performance bonus. Therefore, if the loan originator organization elects to include the 401(k) contribution in total compensation for these purposes, the loan originator organization may pay the individual loan originator a performance bonus of up to $20,000 (i.e., 10 percent of $200,000 in total compensation); if the loan originator organization does not include the 401(k) contribution in calculating total compensation, the bonus may be up to $18,333.33."
