The conditions specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2) are determined according to activity that occurred in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the consumer's application was received. Section 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, the creditor must have extended credit only to consumers with income that did not exceed the limit then in effect for low- and moderate-income households, as specified in regulations prescribed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to 24 CFR 570.3. For example, a creditor has satisfied the requirement in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) if the creditor extended credit only to consumers with incomes that did not exceed the limit in effect on the dates the creditor received each consumer's individual application. The condition specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3), which relates to the current extension of credit, provides that the extension of credit must be to a consumer with income that does not exceed the limit specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received the consumer's application. For example, assume that a creditor with a tax exemption ruling under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has satisfied the conditions identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2). If, on May 21, 2014, the creditor in this example extends credit secured by a dwelling to a consumer whose application reflected income in excess of the limit identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received that consumer's application, the creditor has not satisfied the condition in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3) and this extension of credit is not exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.43(c) through (f).",

Second, a servicer must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee.

For example, a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) may not have a loan term in excess of 30 years because longer terms are prohibited for qualified mortgages under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(ii). Similarly, a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) may not result in a balloon payment because \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(i)(C) provides that qualified mortgages may not have balloon payments except as provided under \u00a7 1026.43(f). However, a covered transaction need not comply with \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(vi), which prohibits consumer monthly debt-to-income ratios in excess of 43 percent. A covered transaction therefore can be a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) even though the consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio is greater than 43 percent.",

The data submitted by the creditor at the time of loan delivery indicated that the various loan terms met the product type, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, and other MBS pooling criteria, and MBS issuance disclosures to investors reflected this loan data. However, after delivery and MBS issuance, a quality control review determines that the loan violates the pooling criteria. The loan still meets eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae products and loan terms. Fannie Mae, however, requires the creditor to repurchase the loan due to the violation of MBS pooling requirements. Assume that the quality control review determination is accurate. Because the loan still meets Fannie Mae\u2019s eligibility requirements, it remains a qualified mortgage based on these facts and circumstances. ",

Creditors, assignees, and servicers providing the required notice to a consumer whose ARM is converting to a fixed-rate mortgage, may modify the model language to explain that the interest rate will no longer adjust. Creditors, assignees, and servicers electing to provide consumers with interest rate notices in cases where the interest rate adjusts without a corresponding change in payment may modify the forms to fit that circumstance. A payment-option ARM, which is an ARM permitting consumers to choose among several different payment options for each billing period, is an example of a loan that may require modification of the \u00a7 1026.20(c) model and sample forms.

Some repurchase or indemnification demands are not related to eligibility criteria at consummation. See comment 43(e)(4)-4.

However, evidence of whether a particular loan satisfied the \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) eligibility criteria at consummation may be brought to light in the course of dealing over a particular demand, depending on the facts and circumstances.

For example, assume a servicer services 5,400 mortgage loans. Of these mortgage loans, the servicer owns or originated 4,800 mortgage loans, voluntarily services 300 mortgage loans that it does not own or did not originate for an unaffiliated nonprofit organization for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees, and services 300 reverse mortgage transactions that it does not own and did not originate. Because the only mortgage loans considered are the 4,800 mortgage loans owned or originated by the servicer, the servicer is considered a small servicer and qualifies for the small servicer exemption with regard to all 5,400 mortgage loans it services. Note that reverse mortgages and mortgage loans secured by consumers' interests in timeshare plans, in addition to not being considered in determining small servicer qualification, are also exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. In contrast, although charitably serviced mortgage loans, as defined by \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), are likewise not considered in determining small servicer qualification, they are not exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. Thus, a servicer that does not qualify as a small servicer would not have to provide periodic statements for reverse mortgages and timeshare plans because they are exempt from the rule, but would have to provide periodic statements for mortgage loans it charitably services.",
