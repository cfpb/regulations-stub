                        "Four of the Bureau's January 2013 mortgage rules included provisions that provide for special treatment under various Regulation Z requirements forcertain credit transactions in connection with \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas: (1) \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) provides an exemption to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule's escrow requirement for HPMLs; (2) \u00a7 1026.43(f) provides an allowance to originate balloon-payment qualified mortgages under the 2013 ATR Final Rule; (3) \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) provides an exemption from the balloon payment prohibition on high-cost mortgages under the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule for balloon-payment qualified mortgages; and (4) \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) provides an exemption from a requirement to obtain a second appraisal for certain HPMLs under the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule. These provisions rely on the criteria for \u201crural\u201d and/or \u201cunderserved\u201d counties set forth in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), respectively, adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, which takes effect on June 1, 2013. Two of the special provisions for creditors operating predominantly in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas were set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA, but the terms were not defined by statute. TILA section 129D, as added and amended by Dodd-Frank Act sections 1461 and 1462 and implemented by \u00a7 1026.35(b), generally requires that creditors establish escrow accounts for HPMLs secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling, but the statute also authorizes the Bureau to exempt from this requirement transactions by a creditor that, among other criteria, \u201coperates predominantly in rural or underserved areas.\u201d TILA section 129D(c)(1). Similarly, the ability-to-repay provisions in Dodd-Frank Act section 1412 contain a set of criteria with regard to certain balloon-payment mortgages originated and held in portfolio by certain creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas, allowing those loans to be considered qualified mortgages.SeeTILA section 129C(b)(2)(E), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(2)(E). In the 2013 Escrows and ATR Final Rules, the Bureau implemented the HPML escrows requirement and the section 1412 balloon-payment qualified mortgage provision through \u00a7\u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.43(f), respectively. In addition, the Bureau adopted an exemption to the general prohibition of balloon payments for high-cost mortgages when those mortgages meet the criteria for balloon-payment qualified mortgages set forth in \u00a7 1026.43(f), as part of the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, in \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C). Finally, the Bureau and other Federal agencies adopted \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H), which provides an exemption from a requirement to obtain a second appraisal for certain HPMLs under the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule for credit transactions used to acquire property in rural counties.",
                        "Through the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau adopted \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) to define \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d respectively for the purposes of the four rules discussed above that contain special provisions that use one or both of those terms. The 2013 Escrows Final Rule also provided comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 to clarify further the criteria for \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d counties, and provided that the Bureau will annually update on its public Web site a list of counties that meet the definitions of rural and underserved in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv). In advance of the rule's June 1, 2013, effective date, the Bureau proposed to amend \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) and comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 to clarify how to determine whether a county is rural or underserved for the purposes of these provisions."

                        "The Bureau received several comments discussing the overall regulatory scheme regarding how \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d should be defined. Most of these comments argued for an expanded scope for the \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d definitions. One industry trade association suggested that the rural definition should include all non-metropolitan counties, as well as communities with populations of less than 50,000. Other commenters suggested that the Bureau should use Census Bureau data differently, and one suggested that any place not within one of the Census Bureau's \u201cUrbanized Areas,\u201d which contain 50,000 or more people, be considered rural. A credit union association suggested that credit unions with \u201crural\u201d community charters should be exempt, and that only those creditors with a physical presence in an underserved area should be considered in relation to the underserved exemption. Some commenters felt that the rule was too confusing, making compliance difficult. One credit union was concerned about the impact the escrows rule would have on mobile home lending. One commenter stated that, although the clarification presented in the proposal was welcome, there is still too much confusion regarding the escrows rule, and that its effective date should be postponed to January 2014. In addition, two commenters suggested that the Bureau apply exemptions based solely on the size of a creditor, regardless of location.",
                        "Although the Bureau has examined these comments, the proposed rule presented only very limited changes and clarifications to the 2013 Final Escrows Rule, and solicited comments on those narrow issues. Broader concerns such as those expressed by the foregoing commenters about preserving consumers' access to credit will be addressed in the Bureau's final rule under the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, which the Bureau expects to issue shortly. The specific provisions included in the proposal are discussed below, along with comments responsive to those issues.",
                        "One industry commenter supported generally the clarifications provided in the rule. Other industry commenters chose to neither support nor oppose the \u201cadjacent\u201d clarification, and asked that there be more analysis of the impact of excluding counties from the rural definition if they are \u201cadjacent\u201d to a metropolitan area.",
                        "Industry commenters opposed the proposed method for determining the status of a new county, arguing that a new county should be considered rural if 50% of its land is taken from counties that were previously considered rural."

As adopted in January, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and its commentary stated that the Bureau would designate or determine which counties are rural or underserved for the purposes of the special provisions of the four rules discussed above. However, that was not the Bureau's intent. Rather, the Bureau intended to require determinations of \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d status to be made by creditors as prescribed by \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), but also intended for the Bureau to apply both tests to each U.S. county and publish an annual list of counties that satisfy either test for a given calendar year, which creditors may rely upon as a safe harbor. Therefore, the Bureau proposed modifications to \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) and comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i for the purposes of clarification and consistency with these provisions.",
                        "As adopted in January 2013, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) defines \u201crural\u201dbased on currently applicable UICs established by the USDA-ERS. The UICs are based on the definitions of \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d and \u201cmicropolitan statistical area\u201d as developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), along with other factors reviewed by the ERS that place counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending, in part, on the size of the largest city and town in the county. Based on these definitions, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) as adopted states that a county is \u201crural\u201d during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area, as those terms are defined by OMB and applied under currently applicable UICs.",
                        "As adopted, comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i explained that, for the purposes of the provision, the terms \u201cmetropolitan statistical areas\u201d and \u201cmicropolitan statistical areas adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area\u201d are given the same meanings used by USDA-ERS for the purposes of determining UICs. The USDA-ERS considers micropolitan counties as \u201cadjacent\u201d to a metropolitan statistical area for this purpose if they abut a metropolitan statistical area and have at least 2% of employed persons commuting to work in the core of the metropolitan statistical area. It was thus implicit in this comment that \u201cadjacent\u201d is given the same meaning used by the USDA-ERS for the purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).",
                        "Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that additional commentary explaining the meaning of \u201cadjacent\u201d more directly would be useful to facilitate compliance with \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) and the provisions that rely on it. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to state expressly that \u201cadjacent\u201d entails physical contiguity with a metropolitan statistical area where certain minimum commuting standards are also met, as defined by the USDA-ERS. The Bureau believed that this would be consistent with USDA-ERS's use of \u201cadjacent\u201d and better explain the rule for compliance purposes.",
                        "Similarly, the Bureau proposed language to specify under \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) how \u201crural\u201d status should be determined for a county that does not have a currently applicable UIC because it was created after the USDA-ERS last categorized counties by UIC. Because the USDA-ERS only updates UICs decennially based on the most recent census, it is possible that new counties may be created that will not have a designated UIC until after the next census. In such instances, clarification was needed to explain how \u201crural\u201d status would be determined. The Bureau thus proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to address this issue and explain that any such county is considered \u201crural\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken were themselves rural under the rule.",

                        "Section 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) creates an exemption from the HPML escrow requirement for transactions by creditors operating in rural or underserved counties, if they meet certain criteria involving the loans they originatedduring the preceding calendar year.Thus, the availability of the rural or underserved exemption always follows a year after the origination activity that makes a creditor eligible for the exemption.",
                        "As adopted by the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) stated that a county would be \u201cunderserved\u201d during a calendar year if, \u201caccording to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for that year,\u201d no more than two creditors extended covered transactions, as defined in \u00a7 1026.43(b)(1), secured by a first lien, five or more times in the county. However, HMDA data typically are released for a given calendar year during the third quarter of each subsequent calendar year. It is thus not generally possible for creditors to make determinations concerning whether a county was underserved during the preceding calendar year based on that preceding year's HMDA data, because such data likely will not be available until late in the following year. In wording \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) as it did, the Bureau did not intend to require the use of HMDA data that would not be available at the time the determination of a county's \u201cunderserved\u201d status was made; the Bureau's intent was to provide for the use of the most recent HMDA data available at the time of the determination.",
                        "The Bureau therefore proposed to amend \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) to clarify that a county is considered \u201cunderserved\u201d during a given calendar year based on HMDA data for \u201cthe preceding calendar year\u201d as opposed to \u201cthat calendar year.\u201d This look-back feature coordinates with the look-back feature in the exemption itself at \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), so that a creditor would rely on the underserved status of a county based on HMDA data from two years previous to the use of the exemption, which are the most recent data available for use as the Bureau intended. The Bureau also proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.ii to conform to this change, and to add comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.ii to provide an example.",
                        "The Bureau proposed language in \u00a7 1026.35(e) to keep in place existing requirements contained in \u00a7 1026.35(b)concerning assessment of consumers' ability to repay an HPML and limitations on prepayment penalties for HPMLs. These provisions were originally adopted by the Board in 2008, and will be supplanted by the Bureau's new rules implementing similar Dodd-Frank requirements in \u00a7 1026.43 on January 10, 2014.",
