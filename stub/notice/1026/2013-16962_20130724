        "24":"This section-by-section analysis discusses the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal by reference to the Board's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, which the Board proposed to amend, and discusses this final rule by reference to the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, which this final rule amends.",
        "25":"The Bureau may prescribe rules that revise, add to, or subtract from the criteria of section 129D(b) of TILA if the Bureau determines that such rules are in the interest of consumers and the public interest.See15 U.S.C. 1639d note. These exceptions are also justified by section 105(a) of TILA which provides that the Bureau in its regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions that the Bureau judges are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.See15 U.S.C. 1604(a).",
        "26":"The Bureau notes that open-end credit transactions are excluded from section 129D(a) of TILA under Dodd-Frank Act section 1461.See15 U.S.C. 1639d.",
        "27":"Reverse mortgages are also excluded from section 129D(a) of TILA under Dodd-Frank Act section 1461.See15 U.S.C. 1639d.",

        "33":"A review of 2011 HMDA data shows creditors that otherwise meet the criteria of \u00a7 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) and originate between 200 and 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions per year average 134 transactions per year retained in portfolio. Over a five year period, the total portfolio for these creditors would average 670 mortgage obligations.",
        "32":"The Bureau has similarly attempted to maintain consistency between the asset-size limit, annual originations threshold, and requirements concerning portfolio transactions as between the final rules that it is adopting with regard to balloon qualified mortgages and the escrow exemption and its separate proposal to create a new type of qualified mortgage originated and held by smallportfolio creditors. The Bureau is seeking comment in that proposal on these elements and on whether other adjustments are appropriate to the existing rules to maintain continuity and reduce compliance burden.Seethe 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal.",

        "35":"The ERS places counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending on the size of the largest city or town in the county or in adjacent counties. Descriptions of UICs can be found on the ERS Web site athttp://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.",
        "34":"The $2 billion threshold reflects the purposes of the exemption and the structure of the mortgage servicing industry. The Bureau's choice of $2 billion in assets as a threshold for purposes of TILA section 129D(c)(4) does not imply that a threshold of that type or of that magnitude would be an appropriate way to distinguish small firms for other purposes or in other industries.",
        "16":"73 FR 44522 (July 30, 2008).",
        "36":"A review of data from HMDA reporters indicates that there were 700 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of new \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 391 originate higher-priced mortgage loans in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 2,110 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 391 creditors originated 12,921 higher-priced mortgage loans, representing 30 percent of their 43,359 total mortgage loan originations. A review of data from credit unions indicates that there were 830 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 415 originate balloon-payment and hybrid mortgages in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 3,551 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 415 creditors originated 4,980 balloon-payment mortgage originations, representing 20 percent of their 24,968 total mortgage loan originations.",
        "37":"Section 1026.35(c) is being adopted separately by the Bureau jointly with other Federal agencies, to implement the new appraisal requirements in TILA section 129H, in the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule, as discussed in part III.C, above. That new section provides an exemption for creditors operating in rural, but not underserved, areas. Consequently, the single, combined list of all counties that are either rural or underserved that the Bureau will publish annually for purposes of the exemption from this final rule's escrow requirement is inadequate for the analogous purpose under the new appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c).",
        "157":"See, e.g., Robinson v. Shelby Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 566 F.3d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[I]t is also well-established that `[p]ublic policy strongly favors settlement of disputes without litigation. * * * Settlement agreements should therefore be upheld whenever equitable and policy considerations so permit.'\u201d).",
        "14":"The Bureau notes that it has now posted the official list of rural and underserved counties on its public Web site for use with mortgages consummated from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. The final, official list is identical to the preliminary list posted on the Bureau's public Web site on March 12, 2013. Creditors may rely as a safe harbor for compliance with the relevant regulations on the official lists of rural and underserved counties posted by the Bureau. The official list for use in 2014 will be posted when the necessary data become available."
