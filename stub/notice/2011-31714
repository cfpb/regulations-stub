    "abstract": "Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) transferred rulemaking authority for a number of consumer financial protection laws from seven Federal agencies to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) as of July 21, 2011. The Bureau is in the process of republishing the regulations implementing those laws with technical and conforming changes to reflect the transfer of authority and certain other changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act. In light of the transfer of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's (Board's) rulemaking authority for the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to the Bureau, the Bureau is publishing for public comment an interim final rule establishing a new Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity). This interim final rule does not impose any new substantive obligations on persons subject to the existing Regulation B, previously published by the Board.",

Section 1022(b)(2)(B) requires that the Bureau \u201cconsult with the appropriate prudential regulators or other Federal agencies prior to proposing a rule and during the comment process regarding consistency with prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies.\u201d The manner and extent to which these provisions apply to interim final rules and to benefits, costs, and impacts that are compelled by statutory changes rather than discretionary Bureau action is unclear.
