        "88":"Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. See 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.",
        "89":"As noted above, this cancellation language may be amended to the extent \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies.",
        "67":"The term \u201cState\u201d is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).",
        "82":"See also EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient \u201cshall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act\u201d).",
        "83":"The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. See TX Admin. Code \u00a7 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under \u00a7 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.",
        "80":"See 76 FR 29923.",
        "81":"See \u00a7 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. See \u00a7 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).",
        "86":"12 CFR 1005.18.",
        "87":"Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.",
        "84":"As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.",
        "85":"See also \u00a7 1005.30(a), which defines the term \u201cagent\u201d for purposes of the rule.",
        "9":"For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.",
        "8":"Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an \u201cincorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.\u201d",
        "77":"Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is \u201cmarketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate\u201d or \u201cmarketed to the general public\u201d for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. See comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.",
        "76":"Due to a scrivener's error, \u00a7 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term \u201cOther Transfer Fees\u201d, \u201cOther Transfer Taxes\u201d, or \u201cOther Transfer Fees and Taxes\u201d, or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term \u201cOther Fees and Taxes\u201d. The terms set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word \u201ctransfer\u201d; in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.",
        "73":"The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. See 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).",
        "91":"See Model Forms A-30 through A-35 and A-38 through A-40.",
        "90":"These changes were also made to Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, and A-35 where the language in Model Form A-37 is used. The changes are also reflected in the Spanish language disclosures.",
        "93":"See Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.",
        "92":"See Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.",
        "94":"One of the stylistic changes made to the Spanish language model forms was to change the format for the dates to eliminate possible consumer confusion as to the day, the month, and the year. Similar changes have been made to the English language model forms for consistency.",
        "79":"A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.",
        "78":"As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.",
        "11":"Section 1005.31(a)(2) generally requires disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to be in writing.  The provision makes exceptions for pre-payment disclosures, which may be provided electronically.",
        "10":"See http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_bic_details.",
        "13":"Also in the interest of clarity, these taxes are described as \u201cforeign taxes,\u201d although it is possible that the taxes collected by a person other than the provider could include taxes imposed by a U.S. state or the Federal government where such taxes are not collected by the provider.",
        "12":"In the interest of clarity on the model forms, non-covered third-party fees are referred to as \u201cfees charged by a recipient's bank.\u201d  However, to the extent that the term \u201cbank\u201d is imprecise, a provider may use an alternate term to describe the recipient institution.",
        "15":"In the February Proposal, the Bureau did propose conforming changes to comment 32(c)(3)-1 that referenced the renumbered provisions relating to the permanent exception for transfers to certain countries (what is \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1) in the final rule). The Bureau received no comments on the proposed changes to this comment, and the Bureau is adopting it as proposed.",
        "14":"See Escrow Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 4725 (Jan. 22, 2013); Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 6407 (Jan. 30, 2013; High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 FR 6855 (Jan. 31, 2013); Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, 78 FR 10695 (Feb. 14, 2013); Disclosure and Delivery Requirements for Copies of Appraisals and Other Written Valuations Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), 78 FR 7215 (Jan. 31, 2013); Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, 78 FR 10367 (Feb. 13, 2013); Loan Originator Compensation Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 11279 (Feb. 15, 2013).",
        "17":"The timing requirement in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) does not prevent a remittance transfer provider from providing this receipt before the date of the transfer. The same is true for disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), which are discussed below.",
        "16":"Section 1005.32(c)(1) contains three methodologies for providing estimates. If a provider chooses to use a non-listed method, \u00a7 1005.32(c) explains that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater then, the estimated amount disclosed to the sender.",
        "18":"Although changes in terms trigger notice requirements in some instances under Regulation E see 12 CFR 1005.10), that provision does not apply to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers."
